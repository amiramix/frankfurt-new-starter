### Transport

#### S-Bahn Light Rail
Station closest to the Office is Eschborn Sud, 5 minute walk away. This is the S-Bahn. It is a light rail train service. This runs frequently. Single to Frankfurt from Eschborn Sud is €2.80, or €7 for an all day multiple journey ticket. S4, S3, S5 run from Frankfurt to Eschborn Sud. Sud means South. Dont confuse this with Eschborn stop as it is further north. And ticket machine can be changed to English, so no need to speak to ticket staff.

#### Buses
Bus tickets can be bought at ticket machines, so show ticket to driver and go.
Check maps for routes

#### Driving
The Germans drive on zee right.

#### Walking
Frankfurt is a walking friendly city, lots of pedestrian crossing points, similar to pelican crossing in the UK. Mind the Germans drive on zee right so look both ways. And if it is traffic light for pedestrians dont walk on red and the Germans stare at you defying the process, this is known as bean bagging the process. See process.


### Places to see
Start at Hauptwache and enjoy. Its one of the key Shopping areas and quite central to a lot of other interesting areas.


## Sunday
Germany shuts down on a sunday. Supermarkets are closed. Only places open will be 24 hours garages, kiosks in city centre, macdonalds, burger king, starbucks, in fact any American Mega Corp will be open. Some cafes may be open. Ikea is closed. Its Germany not Sweden.

## Apps
The following Apps are very useful.

WhatsApp

Messenger

Viber

Google Translate

mytaxi

Allo

AirBnB

DB Navigator

Google Maps

## Sims
You are likely to be using Pay as You Go sims for a while. There are data sims for tablets that you can use on the phone - Ortel is good. 10Gb per month for €20 euros pay as you go.

A sim for calling back home, a cheap lebara or Lyca can be picked up for €8-10 euros. Dump it when you are finished and get a new one. This has 500Mb data and 250 minutes calling.

You may end up have 3 sims and or 3 phones. Your back home sim, a German phone call sim and a German Data Sim

## Laundry
[Laundromat](https://www.google.de/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=laundromat+frankfurt)



## Bank Accounts
Bank account requires a valid passport, and proof of residence. This can either be your agreement with your land lord or the local council registration documents. The bank will then post out your stuff to your address.

## Process
Germany loves its processes and is ruthlessly efficient at following them. Unfortunately this is not to be confused with ruthless process efficiency. Expect things to take a while ... like bank accounts.
